1. Vision
-------

___Vision Statement:___

H@X0rZ! will provide a casual and entertaining experience for a wide range of end-users.

___Mission Statement___

   H@X0rZ! will be a casual web-based card game that is easy to learn and fun to play. As a casual game, it will be approachable and appealing to several age groups and demographics. The learning curve for the game, given its simple system, is nearly linear, and the average person can learn how to play within the course of one or two games.  
   
   The application itself is based on a three-tier web design, employing a front-end server, application server, and a database server to hold player information. The use of both privately and publicly held assets to run the stack will ensure that the overhead of running this game will be minimal. The inclusion of themes and other micro-transactions in the future will also mitigate overhead, and eventually return a profit on the game. An in-game currency, which can be purchased by the players, will be employed for transactions within the game environment itself.  
While our initial iteration of the game is based on hacking themes, we plan to offer additional themes for players to use that will broaden the player base substantially. These can be acquired by the aforementioned microtransactions or as rewards for promoting the game to friends.  

   Advertising and marketing will be on a local scale at the launch of this game, but realized profits will be re-introduced into the model to expand our advertising and widen the audience that we reach. Later developments may also include the expansion to other platforms, including (but not limited to) iOS and Android. While this approach is less widely distributed at the outset, the initial risk involved with this venture is negligible. Growth of this product depends on early users’ impressions of the game; therefore, the vision of this model is crucial to the successful future of this product.  



2. Configuration Management Plan
-----------------------------

   Our team plans to use GitHub and Google Drive for all official documentation and file management. GitHub shall host the most updated versions of important documentation and of the application files. Google Drive will primarily be used for its ease of file transfers and the ability for multiple developers to edit a single document simultaneously in real-time.


3. Process Model
-------------

We are using agile methodology due to time constraints and, as per request of the client, to keep them informed throughout the development process and ensure that our requirements and work continue to match their desired product.

5. Potential Risks
---------------

Human error is a possible risk that can be introduced into the code via the programmers that build and maintain the application. We can potentially face a resource-limitation risk (processing load and data storage) as the server used for this application is an Amazon EC2 instance. Because the main application is free-to-play, there is a possibility that overhead costs can exceed revenue.


6. Team Members/Tasks
------------------

- Will Raziano - I worked mainly on the organizational and leadership aspects of the project. This included setting up and attending all meetings, coding sessions, “client” interaction sessions, and preparation meetings. I also took steps to maintain high morale in the team as a whole, including encouraging team members to take ownership of tasks and general aspects of the project. I worked side by side with team members to dissolve the appearance of leading, and worked to instill a sense of responsibility in all of the team members. I did not do any coding personally, but I did assist Madeline, Ryan, and Chris with some aspects of understanding the implementation of the logic of the game system. I actively participated in the creation and editing of the documentation, including oversight of the delivery of documentation, and meeting with the TA to ensure that everything was correctly documented. I also created the "Privacy Policy" and "Terms and Conditions" documentation. I hosted several coding and preparation sessions in my home, to allow for a relaxed and productive setting. 
- Jonathan Nguyen - I worked in small amounts on client-side sockets for communication (most of my coding in this was done in CSC 3380; during this semester, I helped transition this to Ryan for him to integrate into the system). My primary contribution is in writing documentation and doing technical editing and formatting. This includes the Software Requirement Specification, Software Design Document, Software Testing Document, User Manual, and Project Management Document. I was unable to attend the team meeting on November 19th because I was needed to meet and work on another course's term project. I did, however, remain in contact with my team through GroupMe and Google Drive, allowing me to intermittently assist them as needed.
- Ryan Ngo - Server Design/Implementation, Database
- Chris Schayer - Webpage Design/Implementation
- Hardika Patel - UI Design, Webpage Integration
- Madeline May - I focused primarily on documentation and testing for this project. I did not do any of the coding, but I was in charge of converting all of our final documentation into Markdown for GitHub and making sure they looked presentable and organized. I also helped out with writing documentation, specifically the Project Management Document as well as writing the test cases for the Software Testing Document. I organized the testing process and made sure it corresponded to our testing document. I was not able to attend the meeting on October 29 because my cousin's wedding was that same day.

Our team does not fit one specific team organization. It is a hybrid between the chief programmer and the egoless styles. We have a project manager to generally help keep the team organized as a whole, but each team member leads and is responsible for a specific area of the project, based on their expertise.
