Vision
-------

___Vision Statement:___

H@X0rZ! will provide a casual and entertaining experience for a wide range of end-users.

___Mission Statement___

   H@X0rZ! will be a casual web-based card game that is easy to learn and fun to play. As a casual game, it will be approachable and appealing to several age groups and demographics. The learning curve for the game, given its simple system, is nearly linear, and the average person can learn how to play within the course of one or two games.  
   
   The application itself is based on a three-tier web design, employing a front-end server, application server, and a database server to hold player information. The use of both privately and publicly held assets to run the stack will ensure that the overhead of running this game will be minimal. The inclusion of themes and other micro-transactions in the future will also mitigate overhead, and eventually return a profit on the game. An in-game currency, which can be purchased by the players, will be employed for transactions within the game environment itself.  
While our initial iteration of the game is based on hacking themes, we plan to offer additional themes for players to use that will broaden the player base substantially. These can be acquired by the aforementioned microtransactions or as rewards for promoting the game to friends.  

   Advertising and marketing will be on a local scale at the launch of this game, but realized profits will be re-introduced into the model to expand our advertising and widen the audience that we reach. Later developments may also include the expansion to other platforms, including (but not limited to) iOS and Android. While this approach is less widely distributed at the outset, the initial risk involved with this venture is negligible. Growth of this product depends on early users’ impressions of the game; therefore, the vision of this model is crucial to the successful future of this product.  



Configuration Management Plan
-----------------------------

   Our team plans to use GitHub and Google Drive to do all of our work. GitHub will make it easy to upload our code so that everyone can always have access to the most recent files. This will also help with integration, when it comes time to test. Google Drive will make it easy to collaborate on documentation throughout the project.


Process Model
-------------

We will be using Agile methods due to time constraints specified by the client.

Potential Risks
---------------

There is always human risk with a game. Human error can be introduced in the code by programmers. We could be facing resource risk because we will be using an EC2 instance. There is the possiblitly that we will be charged more than we are making off of the game due to high amount of users. 



Team Members/Tasks
------------------

Our team is unique in the fact that it does not fit one specific team organization. It is a mix between a chief programmer team and an egoless team. We have a project manager to help keep the team organized and on task. All team members are responsible for a certain area of the project based on expertise, making it similar to an egoless organization as well.
