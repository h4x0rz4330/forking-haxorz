User Manual


=======================OVERVIEW========================


“H@x0rz!” is a turn-based multiplayer card game that can be played between 2, 3, or 4 players. Each “game” is broken down into “rounds” - sessions of gameplay that end with one winner. Rounds are played until one player wins enough times to be declared the winner of the game.


A single deck of cards is placed at the center of the board and shared between all players. It is composed of 16 cards, each activating an effect when being played or while in a player hand.

=======================GAMEPLAY========================


The required number of round-wins to win a game are as follows:
* 2-Player: 7 wins
* 3-Player: 5 wins
* 4-Player: 3 wins


Objective: Be the last player standing to win the round.


1. Before the round begins, cards are removed from the deck based on the number of players. This is to keep players from figuring out exactly what cards are left in the game as the deck runs out. For 2-player games, 3 cards are removed. For 3 or 4-player games, 1 card is removed.
2. Each player is dealt 1 card from the deck. Cards owned by a player are in their “hand” and are only seen by themselves until played (or when they are targeted by the R.A.T. or Cybersecurity Officer card).
3. A player is chosen at random to play the first turn. Turns then proceed in clockwise order until any of following happens:
* All but one player is left in the round. That player wins the round.
* A player attempts to draw a card when the deck is empty. All players reveal their remaining card; the highest value card wins. If these values are tied, then the top cards of each player’s discard pile are compared until a winner is decided. If this also ends in a draw, a winner is chosen at random.
1. A player’s turn proceeds in this order:
           i)   The player draws a card from the deck and puts it in their hand.
   ii)  The player chooses one card from their hand to play. That card’s effect is activated;
choices and effects are applied accordingly.
(An exception is Trojan Horse, whose effect is active in the player’s hand,)
After the end of the player’s turn, the next player who is still in the round begins their turn.
